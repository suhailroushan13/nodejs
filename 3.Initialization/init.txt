npm init is a command used in the command line interface to initialize a new Node.js project 
and create a package.json file.

When you run npm init in a project directory, it will prompt you with a series of questions about your project,
such as the project name, version number, description, entry point, test command, author, license, etc. 
Based on your responses, it will generate a package.json file that describes your project and its dependencies.

The package.json file is an essential part of any Node.js project. It defines the project's metadata, 
such as its name, version, author, and license, as well as its dependencies and devDependencies. 
It also includes scripts that can be used to run tasks like building the project, testing it, or deploying it.

Overall, npm init simplifies the process of creating a new Node.js project and ensures that all 
necessary metadata and dependencies are defined in the package.json file.
