Introduction to NodeJS

Node.js vs Browser
Both the browser and Node.js JavaScript as their programming language.
Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application.
With Browser we have access to DOM, Web API where as with Node.js we have modules provide to access to file system, OS.
Node.js supports both the CommonJS and ES module systems require() import()
while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being
implemented.
