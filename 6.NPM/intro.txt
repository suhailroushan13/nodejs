Introduction to NPM

NPM is the Standard package manager for Node.js
As of Sep, 2022 it has around 2.1 Million packages listed in NPM registry
NPM is a way of download and manage dependencies for both frontend and backend applications using JavaScript.
Yarn and pnpm are the alternatives to NPM cli.

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, and it is a package manager for Node.js applications. 
It is used to install, manage, and share Node.js packages, which are collections of 
code and libraries that you can use to add functionality to your Node.js projects.

NPM provides a large repository of over one million packages that you can easily 
install and use in your projects. It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) 
that you can use to manage your Node.js packages and dependencies.

To use NPM, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer, as NPM comes bundled with Node.js. 
Once you have Node.js installed, you can use the npm command to install packages, manage dependencies, 
and run scripts defined in your package.json file.

For example, if you want to install the express package, you can simply run the command npm install express, 
and NPM will download and install the package and its dependencies in your project.

Overall, NPM is a vital tool for Node.js developers, as it makes it easy to install and 
manage packages, share code with others, and build complex Node.js applications.
