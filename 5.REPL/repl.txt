REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, and it is an interactive console or shell that 
allows you to execute code snippets in a programming language and see their results immediately. 
Node.js comes with its own REPL, which you can use to test and experiment with Node.js 
code without having to create a separate file or project.

To start the Node.js REPL, you can simply open your command line interface (CLI) 
and type node followed by the Enter key. This will start the Node.js REPL, 
and you should see a > prompt indicating that you can start typing JavaScript code.

For example, you can type console.log('Hello, world!') in the REPL 
and press Enter, and it will immediately output Hello, world! to the console.

The Node.js REPL also provides several built-in commands, such as .help, 
which displays a list of available commands, .break or Ctrl + C, which 
allows you to exit a multiline expression, and .exit, which allows you 
to exit the REPL altogether.

Overall, the Node.js REPL is a powerful tool for quickly testing and 
prototyping Node.js code, and it can save you a lot of time when 
developing Node.js applications.
